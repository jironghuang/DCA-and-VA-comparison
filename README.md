# DCA-and-VA-comparison

I'm in the midst of investigating the performance between dollar cost averaging (DCA) and value averaging (VA) strategies. In several literature (in particular Michael Eldeson's study), VA proves to be the superior strategy with higher returns, lower cost per share, lower standard deviation.

The studies are mostly based in the US markets, but few studied other markets. I intend to explore the performance of these strategies, via historical index prices in Singapore and US markets and also through Monte-Carlo simulations.

I'm still in the midst of coding, and will try to finalise the results before end of the year. Once completed I will post it on Linkedin!

PS: A lot of inefficient code. I will use more apply functions to improve the efficiency.
